    <p>This website makes it easier to apply for your postal vote.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>You fill out this form.</li>
    <li>We give you a pre-filled out form to print.</li>
    <li>You sign it, and you post it to the local Electoral Registration Officer (we'll tell you the address).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>They need to receive it at least 11 working days before the poll so:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>20th April - for May Elections (Send by 18th April)</li>
    <li>6th June - for EU Referendum (Send by 4th June)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>You can only get a postal vote if you're already registered to vote - <a href="https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote" target="_blank">you can register to vote here</a>.
    You need to register by 18th April to vote in the May Elections, or by the 7th June for the EU Referendum.</p>
    
    <p>This is <b>not</b> an official website - you can download the form and fill it in yourself at <a href="http://www.aboutmyvote.co.uk/register-to-vote/postal-vote-application">aboutmyvote.co.uk</a></p>

    <p>This form can't be used for Northern Ireland - <a href="http://www.eoni.org.uk/">go here</a> instead.</p>
